Active design of therapeutic molecules requires the joint optimization of multiple, potentially competing properties. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) offers a sample-efficient framework for identifying Pareto-optimal drug candidates. At the heart of MOBO is the acquisition function, which determines the next candidate to evaluate by navigating the best compromises among the objectives. In this talk, I show a natural connection between the Pareto front and the extreme quantile of the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF). This link motivates the proposed Pareto-compliant CDF indicator and the associated acquisition function, BOtied. BOtied inherits invariance properties of the CDF well suited for the functional landscape of molecules. Moreover, an efficient implementation with copulas allows it to scale to many objectives. Outperforming state-of-the-art MOBO acquisition functions on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems, BOtied promises to drive model-based decisions for drug discovery.
