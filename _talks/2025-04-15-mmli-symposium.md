LLMs are optimized for average-case behavior, whereas drug design requires us to consider rare, extreme combinations of molecular properties. I present two recent projects: a novel multi-objective acquisition function for Bayesian optimization and multi-target conformal calibration. Both projects use nonparametric vine copulas to model flexible tail dependence, which gives us the structure we need to explore where it matters most.
