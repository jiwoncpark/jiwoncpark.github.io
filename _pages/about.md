I am a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design), [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/ji-won-park). My research focuses on high-dimensional inference and sampling, with a particular emphasis on developing probabilistic algorithms for active, machine-guided molecular design. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu/people/ji-won-park), where I worked on hierarchical Bayesian methods for cosmology. During my Ph.D., I interned at [NASA Ames](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the Flatiron Institute. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Physics from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/).

## Current research focus  
* **Prediction-centric Bayesian optimization**: Developing “prior-free” Bayesian frameworks with LLMs for decision-making under uncertainty in risk-sensitive settings
* **Robust simulation-based inference**: Using physics-driven simulators for likelihood-free inference while accounting for model selection and Sim2Real gap

## Research themes
* **Decision-making under uncertainty (AI4Science)**
    * Multi‑objective Bayesian optimization for molecular design
    * Productionalizing ML-guided design of antibodies, small molecules, and molecular glues tailored to project-specific desiderata
* **Inference and prediction in high dimensions**
    * Semantic uncertainty quantification for LLMs
    * Post-hoc calibration (e.g. conformal prediction, semiparametric methods)
    * Out‑of‑distribution generalization, diagnostics for distribution shifts
* **Sampling in high dimensions**
    * Diversity-steered sampling strategies for LLMs
    * Guidance for diffusion-based generative models
    * Sampling algorithms for non‑log‑concave distributions
