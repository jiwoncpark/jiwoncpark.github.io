I am a Principal Machine Learning Scientist at [Prescient Design](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design), [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/ji-won-park). My research focuses on high-dimensional inference and sampling, with a particular emphasis on developing probabilistic algorithms for active, machine-guided molecular design. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from [Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu/people/ji-won-park), where I worked on hierarchical Bayesian methods for cosmology. During my Ph.D., I interned at [NASA Ames](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/) and the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/) at the Flatiron Institute. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Physics from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/).
